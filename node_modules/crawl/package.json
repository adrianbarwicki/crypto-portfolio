  "readme": "# Crawl - a website crawler / differencer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mmoulton/crawl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mmoulton/crawl)\n\nCrawl, as it's name implies, will crawl around a website, discovering all of the links and their relationships starting from a base URL. The output of crawl is a JSON object representing a sitemap of every resource within a site, including each links outbound references and any inbound refferers.\n\nCrawl is a Node.js based library that can be used as a module within another application, or as a stand alone tool via it's command line interface (CLI).\n\n## Install\n\nTo install crawl you must first have both Node.js and NPM installed, both of which are outside the scope of this tool. See the [Node.js Website](http://nodejs.org) for details on how to install Node.js. Personaly I am found of Tim Caswell's excelent [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) tool for insalling and managing node.\n\nOnce NPM is installed, simply install Crawl by executing the following from the command line:\n\n\tnpm install crawl -g\n\n\n## Command Line Usage\n\nOnce installed, you can explore what crawl can do by simply typing `crawl` into the command line. You will get the built in help that looks something like this:\n\n\tUsage: crawl left [right]\n\n\tOptions:\n\t\t-v, --verbose  Verbose logging                                  [boolean]\n\t\t-P, --pretty   Pretty print the results                         [boolean]\n\t\t-H, --headers  Include the raw response headers in the results  [boolean]\n\t\t-b, --body     Include the raw response body in the results     [boolean]\n\t\t-u, --username HTTP Basic Auth Username                         [string]\n\t\t-p, --password HTTP Basic Auth Password                         [string]\n\nExecuting `crawl http://your-domain.com` will produce results similar to:\n\n\t[\n\t  {\n\t    \"url\": \"http://your-domain.com/\",\n\t    \"status\": 200,\n\t    \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n\t    \"checksum\": \"6959d6e6066e97c3f94a96fb8e5909f4025b27508a09416ac680118953a542b2\",\n\t    \"date\": \"2013-01-22T22:10:39.404Z\",\n\t    \"links\": [\n\t      \"/css/boilerplate.css\",\n\t      ...\n\t      \"http://vimeo.com/your-domain\"\n\t    ],\n\t    \"referrers\": [\n\t      \"http://your-domain.com/\",\n\t      ...\n\t      \"http://your-domain.com/about/\"\n\t    ]\n\t  },\n\t  ...\n\t  {\n\t    \"url\": \"http://your-domain.com/about/\",\n\t    \"status\": 200,\n\t    \"contentType\": \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\",\n\t    \"checksum\": \"cac058cba6f9ba7f5de33f6a3ee07f5442c9cdf5d074a3fdb5e7247a211372a5\",\n\t    \"date\": \"2013-01-22T22:10:39.636Z\",\n\t    \"referrers\": [\n\t      \"http://your-domain.com/\",\n\t      ...\n\t      \"http://your-domain.com/blog/\"\n\t    ],\n\t    \"links\": [\n\t      \"/\",\n\t      ...\n\t      \"/blog/\"\n\t    ]\n\t  }\n\t]\n\n## Programatic Use\n\nCrawl is rather simple to use in your own code. Simple include crawl as a dependency of your project (add to package.json, etc) then integrate like so:\n\n\tvar crawl = require('crawl');\n\n\tcrawl.crawl(\"http://your-domain.com\", function(err, pages) {\n\t\tif (err) {\n\t\t\tconsole.error(\"An error occured\", err);\n\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tconsole.log(JSON.stringify(pages));\n\t});\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\nThe most basic use case for crawl is to crawl a site and use the resulting JSON object as input to another process. See [Capture](http://github.com/mmoulton/capture) for an example of a tool that can consume the output of Crawl to generate screenshots of every page in a website.\n\nFor example, you may crawl and generate screenshots of a site using `crawl` and `capture` by executing the following:\n\n\tcrawl http://your-domain.com | capture\n\nThis will crawl your base url, discovering each page, then feed that to PhantomJS to generate a screenshot of each URL, placing it in the current working directory.\n\n## The MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Mike Moulton\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
